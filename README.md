## Progress Animation 
### Usage of `Canvas` in order to build an animation 

I decided to build a cool progress animation using `Canvas`. The animation is located in the main menu under "Animation" section.
The idea and the design belong completely to UX flame - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbktxnviLKI&ab_channel=UXFLAME.
